The program replicates key functionalities of Microsoft Excel, such as storing data in cells, 
retrieving values from specified cells, and copying single or multiple cells within a specified range, just like Excel.
It can also store formulas in cells and detect when a cell's value cannot be determined 
(e.g., when a formula references a cell involved in a cyclic dependency) using a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
